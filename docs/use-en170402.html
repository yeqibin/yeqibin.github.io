Malcolm Gladwell: "We have a definition in our heads of what an
advantage is — and the definition isn’t right. And what happens as
a result? It means that we make mistakes. It means that we misread
battles between underdogs and giants. It means that we
underestimate how much freedom there can be in what looks like a
disadvantage."

Malcolm Gladwell 的书总能带来超乎读者认知的新论点，如在
<i>Outliers</i> 中认为在成功的要素中，天分远不如于勤奋、运气以及背景重要。
而在 <i>David and Goliath</i> 中则提出弱者未必比强者没有优势，而强者的优
势可能未必是真正的优势。也就是弱者在竞争中完全有可能击败强
者而胜出。Malcolm Gladwell 非常善于找到能恰好支持自己观点的例子，但未必
令人信服。
